I have generated a UI for you to use for the landing page for Shhh Exchange. It is a work in progress, but it is a good start. 

This colour scheme needs to be swapped to use the colour scheme attached to the message making you read this file.

I need the branding to be changed to Shhh Exchange. I cannot have any emoji's used in the UI, this needs to look sleek and professional. 

There needs to be a launch app button added under the hero text. this needs to take the user to a new page where they would sign up to the exchange

This needs to be blank for now. I will implement the sign up page later.

I need the UI to be responsive and work on all devices. 

Please use a browser to confirm that the UI matches the generated-page.htm with the above changes excactly.
